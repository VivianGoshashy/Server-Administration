# Project Phase: Infrastructure Design Proposal

# Overview
NewVue Health is a nonprofit healthcare organization undergoing a phased IT modernization effort. The organization currently operates on an outdated peer-to-peer network that lacks central management, security, and scalability. Your role in this project is to design a high-level infrastructure for Phase 1, which focuses on setting up the IT foundation at the Headquarters (Main Clinic) in Spokane, Washington. This setup will serve as the core environment for future expansions to branch clinics and hybrid cloud integration.

# Objectives
Assess the current state of NewVue Health's environment and propose a virtualized, secure, and scalable infrastructure for the headquarters. Your design will include key server components, high availability planning, and readiness for future cloud integration.

# Scope
Focus your proposal strictly on the HQ (Main Clinic). Assume that once the HQ is fully operational, branch sites and Azure services will connect to it. Your design should address the following areas:

- Core infrastructure services (Active Directory, DHCP, DNS, File/Print, etc.)

- High-level virtualization strategy

- Basic high availability plan

- Remote access and hybrid-readiness

- Server role placement and justification

- Infrastructure diagram

# Server Expectations
Your proposed design should include at least 5 to 6 virtual servers hosted at the HQ. You are responsible for deciding:

- What roles each server will host

- Which roles can be combined (if any)

- How your design ensures performance, security, and scalability

Avoid unnecessary complexity. Design with strategy and justification. Your decisions should align with the business drivers and technical requirements outlined in the project scenario.
