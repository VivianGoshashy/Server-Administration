# Finals: NewVue Health Infrastructure Project Report

# Background
Throughout this quarter, you have served as the systems administration team supporting NewVue Health, a healthcare organization in Spokane, WA. Your mission was to modernize the company’s outdated peer-to-peer network by designing and implementing a secure, scalable, and hybrid Windows Server infrastructure integrated with Microsoft cloud services.

Over the course of this project, you:

- Designed and implemented a complete server architecture using Windows Server 2022 as the foundation for centralized management and security.

- Developed an Active Directory infrastructure, including domain controllers, organizational units, users, groups, and applied Group Policy configurations.

- Configured and deployed storage and file services, incorporating FSRM quotas, file screens, and DFS namespaces to organize and manage departmental data access.

- Implemented Storage Replica to ensure data redundancy, resiliency, and high availability across critical file servers.

- Configured core networking services such as static IP addressing, DNS, and DHCP to enable name resolution and dynamic network management.

- Set up a Microsoft Cloud infrastructure, establishing a Microsoft 365 tenant and Azure environment to extend services beyond the local network.

- Integrated the on-premises infrastructure with Azure Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) for hybrid identity and seamless connectivity with Microsoft 365 services.

- Designed and implemented a monitoring and backup strategy to ensure data integrity, operational continuity, and recovery readiness.

Having completed this full infrastructure deployment, your next step is to prepare a comprehensive professional report documenting your work — the kind of deliverable expected from a systems administrator at the conclusion of an enterprise project.

# Purpose
In professional IT environments, technical implementation is only one part of the job — the other is clear, thorough, and professional documentation.
System administrators are responsible for producing reports that record configurations, justify design decisions, demonstrate testing, and communicate outcomes to management or clients.

The purpose of this assignment is to help you demonstrate that skill by producing a formal project report that documents your implementation of the NewVue Health infrastructure.

Through this assignment, you will:

- Present your completed project using a professional reporting structure

- Explain the design, configuration, and outcomes of your implementation

- Reflect on challenges, solutions, and lessons learned

- Recommend future improvements and maintenance strategies

- Practice documentation as a core administrative and communication skill

This report represents the culmination of your work on the NewVue Health Infrastructure Modernization Initiative and will serve as a professional record of your deployment.
